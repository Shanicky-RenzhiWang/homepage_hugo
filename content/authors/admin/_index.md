### About me ##

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in University of Alberta, advised by Prof. [Lei Ma](https://www.malei.org/)ï¼Œand I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaofei Xie](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/) during my visit to Singapore Management University. My primary research area is the testing for Autonomous Driving System and AI-CPS. I received my M.Eng. degree from Xidian University, where I was advised by Prof. [Cong Tian](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/ctian/en/index.html), with a research focus on the transferability of adversarial examples. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Xian Jiaotong University, majoring in Process Equipment and Control Engineering. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I was employed as a software engineer at Intel, buddied by [Xiaochuan Luo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086934684) and [James Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xu-james-834550a/).
