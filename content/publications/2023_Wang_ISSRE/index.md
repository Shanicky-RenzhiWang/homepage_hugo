    abstract: "Designing efficient testing for Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) presents a crucial challenge in ensuring their quality. Thorough tests are the keys to their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. However, real-world testing for ADS is usually expensive and hard to scale. Meanwhile, simulation-based testing has gained popularity due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, there exist certain limitations in simulation-based testing. The inherent hardware uncertainty typically impacts the robustness of ADS in real-world contexts. Nevertheless, current approaches often neglect this crucial factor and assume the hardware is perfect. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step and design a test pipeline for simulation-based testing with possible natural deviations. We validate the effectiveness of our testing pipeline on a multi-model ADS in 11 typical scenarios, each containing more than 60 â€¦"
